  <h1>Question creation guidelines and the "Featured" status</h1>
    
	<h2>Question guidelines</h2>
	<p>In order to achieve the most votes for your questions, it is recommended you follow these guidelines:
	<ul>
	   <li class = "lists">Questions should be as non-biased as possible. E.g. A question such as "Do you think that people should vote
	       yes in this election?" leads the answerer towards a 'yes' answer. A better way of writing it would be
		   "How do you think people should vote in this election?"; this is a much more neutral question.</li>
		   </br>
	   <li class = "lists">Correct grammar and spelling should be used.</li>
	   </br>
	   <li class = "lists">Answers should be specific enough for a person to choose from but cover a wide enough area as possible.</li>
	   </br>
	   <li class = "lists">Questions should ideally be applicable to people no matter their location, this is the purpose of the site; to
	       see how opinions change across geographical regions.</li>
		</br>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>The "Featured" status</h2>
	<p>This is our way of rewarding users who consistently produce content that is well appreciated by the community.
	   When a user has had enough questions become 'live' they will gain this status, any further questions created
	   by them will be flagged as "featured" as a sign that they will likely be of high quality and will be shown 
	   prominently on the home page (even higher than sponsored results).</p>
	   
	<h2>Globe Icons</h2>
	<p>The following globe icons allow users to identify information about questions:
	<ul>
	   <li class = "lists"><img id="questionInfoIcon" src="greyGlobe.png" style="padding-right:1em" width="15" height="15">This grey globe represents
	   the majority of questions on the site. This icon means that the question you are looking at is a normal question.</li>
		   </br>
	   <li class = "lists"><img id="questionInfoIcon" src="goldenGlobe.png" style="padding-right:1em" width="15" height="15">The golden globe is used to
	   represent any question that is sponsored, i.e., a company, organisation or individual has paid to make it appear.</li>
		   </br>
	   <li class = "lists"><img id="questionInfoIcon" src="blueGlobe.png" style="padding-right:1em" width="15" height="15">The blue globe represents
	   the best questions and users on the site. It represents any question made by a user that has the featured status (as mentioned above). A featured
	   user will also gain this symbol on their account page.</li>
		   </br>
	</ul>
	</p>

	   then look to see whether they should be allowed.
	   <ol>
	   <li class = "lists">Your username must not contain offensive language.</li>
	   </br>
	   <li class = "lists">Any question (including its answers) must not contain offensive language.</li>
	   </br>
	   <li class = "lists">Questions must not be offensive to any group of people (e.g. sexist, homophobic, racist...).</li>
	   </br>
	   <li class = "lists">You must not create 'spam' questions (questions with no meaning created in large quantities).</li>
	   </br>
	   <li class = "lists">Questions must not be used to advertise a site, product or any other type of object.</li>
	   </ol>
